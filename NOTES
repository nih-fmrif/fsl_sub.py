- Do we need the SGE/qsub stuff? If not, significantly cleans up fsl_sub
- Could use some refactoring once functionality is fully tested, especially if we remove SGE stuff
- I haven't tested on Biowulf because I haven't figured out how yet
    - I have https://github.com/ReproNim/simple_workflow
    - I load modules `Anaconda` and `fsl`
    - ... The true `fsl_sub` is prepended on my path and will be in sub-shells, correct?
    - Doesn't allow me to test all options
    - It might be better to come up with a quick test suite that runs `fsl_sub` directly, testing each option

Things to test:
- simple command-line options
- taskfiles
- environment variables

Things to remove:
- sge_arch
- queue stuff (queue name, qconf, qstat)
- PE name/threads (remove everything except setting OMP_NUM_THREADS)

Things to add:
- swarm options: per-job memory, threads, processes, etc.
